## 🚀 Overview

NetSentinel is an experimental open-source project exploring **AI-driven software development** and **DevOps practices** through a real-world network monitoring system.

The project monitors VPN nodes and network connectivity to detect:

- availability issues
- latency degradation
- connectivity anomalies
- potential regional blocking events

This repository is intentionally developed with AI acting as a technical lead, guiding iterative improvements and architectural evolution.

## 🧠 Philosophy

NetSentinel is not just a monitoring tool.

It is an experiment in:

- AI-assisted engineering workflows
- repository-driven context
- iterative DevOps maturity
- autonomous development patterns

Human role:
- architecture decisions
- direction and validation

AI role:
- propose iterations
- implement changes
- review and improve system design

## 🗺️ Roadmap (High-Level)

- **Phase 1** — Monitoring MVP
- **Phase 2** — Operational maturity
- **Phase 3** — Intelligent network analysis

See `ROADMAP.md` for details.

## ⚙️ Project Status

Early bootstrap phase.

The repository currently contains project structure and AI workflow configuration.
Application code will evolve iteratively.

## 🤖 AI Development Model

This project uses repository-based context files:

- `AGENTS.md` — AI operating rules
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — project intent
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — current system memory
- `ROADMAP.md` — long-term direction

AI agents read these files to maintain continuity across sessions.
