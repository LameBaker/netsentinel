# Project Context

## Purpose

NetSentinel is a personal learning project focused on:
- AI-assisted coding using Codex
- DevOps skill development
- network monitoring experimentation

The system monitors VPN nodes and network accessibility.

## Initial Motivation

The author operates VPN nodes and wants to monitor:
- availability
- latency
- regional blocking behavior
- connectivity anomalies

Utility is secondary to learning AI-driven engineering workflows.

## Development Philosophy

This project is intentionally developed with AI acting as a technical lead.

Human role:
- approve architecture
- guide direction

AI role:
- propose iterations
- implement features
- review improvements

## Current Scope (MVP)

- register VPN node
- perform TCP connectivity checks
- measure latency
- store historical results
